**Responsive image using withArtDirection**

With the use of withArtDirection you can display visually different image at different sizes. this includes displaying simplified logo or a tighter crop on profile picture when viewing on a small screen. You need to get the differents images from graphql and you should be able to write a media query for each size.

The aspect ratio is set by the default image and doesnâ€™t automatically change with the different sources. The way to handle this is to use CSS media queries. I tried using the code provided in the documentation it didn't work for me, so I tried overriding the default width and height of the image wrapper and it's working fine. This is a bad solution but it's working,I wonder if we can do it in a better way!

**Grayscale image**

You can convert image to grayscale by setting grayscale to true on the transformOptions object.
